    We do this to have fun and bring cheer, but our goal is to raise funds for local nonprofits. <b>Please consider making a donation when you vote</b> to honor the hard work of our Gingerbread Creators

    All donations will be split 50/50 between the Hillsborough Arts Council (HAC) and Orange Congregations in Mission
    (OCIM) to support the arts and our local food bank.</b>
