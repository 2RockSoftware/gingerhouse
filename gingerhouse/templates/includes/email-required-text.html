    <h2>EMAIL ADDRESS REQUIREMENT</h2>
    
    Weâ€™re just a little group with a cheery gingerbread competition.
    
    To make it easy for people to only vote once in each category, we are keeping track of votes with email addresses. 
    
    We have a temporary spreadsheet that will be deleted at the end of the month. We will not use your email for anything else or share it with anyone in any way.
